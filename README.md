# Netflix-Movies-Data-Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing more than 9,000 movies available on Netflix. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to answer critical business questions that can guide Netflix’s strategic decisions, particularly around content selection, audience preferences, and engagement.

The dataset includes key details about each movie, such as the title, genre, release year, number of votes, and popularity scores. Through this analysis, we provide valuable insights into movie trends, popular genres, and the relationship between popularity and other movie features.
